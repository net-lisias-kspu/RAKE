//Snacks! Module Manager Patch for GoingUnderground mod. Implementing the necessary modules onto the RAKE parts.

// All Rake Parts with a recyler function deliberately start with less than their total Snack capacity.
// It is assumed that there would not be sufficient space for all the Snacks until the part is deployed,
// so only a portion (usually 10% except for Bilby) can be accomodated. Fill it up when you unpack. 

@PART[rakeArmadilloTEST]
{
	//This is calibrated for 6 kerbals at 100% efficiency
	//(note that this is deliberat in terms of the Armadillo to reflect that it is designed
	//for shift working, not permanent maximum capacity.
	//when they consume 1 snack per meal and 1 meal per day. For your custom recycler,
	//Take into account the number of kerbals it should support along with the meals and snacks.
	//In game, the player can adjust the efficiency of the recycler from 10% to 100%.
