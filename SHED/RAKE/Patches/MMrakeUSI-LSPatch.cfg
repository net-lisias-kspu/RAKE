//USI-LS Module Manager Patch for GoingUnderground mod. Implementing the necessary modules and resources onto the RAKE parts.

// All Rake Parts with a recyler function deliberately start with less than their total Snack capacity.
// It is assumed that there would not be sufficient space for all the Snacks until the part is deployed,
// so only a portion (usually 10% except for Bilby) can be accomodated. Fill it up when you unpack. 

@PART[rakeArmadilloTEST]:FOR[USILifeSupport]
{
	//This is calibrated for 6 kerbals at 60% efficiency
	//(note that this is deliberat in terms of the Armadillo to reflect that it is designed
	//for shift working, not permanent maximum capacity.
	//Take into account the number of kerbals it should support.
